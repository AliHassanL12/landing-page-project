# landing-page-project
In this project, the main aim was to be able to create a landing page using html and css. 
It can be explained that through this project I have been able to solidify my skills in HTML and CSS
and thus feel more confident in them. This will allow me to swiftly progress to javascript with the 
confidence that I have the fundamental skills required to progress.
